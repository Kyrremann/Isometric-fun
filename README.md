# Isometric-fun
I'm testing out Kenney.nl isometric tiles

## Input
* Move tile with mouse
* Left click to place tile
* Right click to rotate (not working properly as the tiles are not sorted)
* Shift + scroll to zoom in or out
* Scroll to cycle through different tiles
 * You can also use + and -
 * 1 takes you to the first tile
* Escape to quit

## TODO
* Add sidebar that show the current tile and what is before and after
* Scrolling of the map
